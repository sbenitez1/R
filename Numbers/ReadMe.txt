This respository has as purpose to study the dataset "Digit Recognizer" 
in  Kaggle (see https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer for more 
details). 

First, I try to understand the data by plotting it. For that, I have
first created the script "matrix2plot.R". There, someone can insert a 
chain of 28x28 pixels (in the format of the data) so that the code
will transform such data into a draw.

Secondly, some experiments are run. Starting from the Random Forest, to
continue with the Support Vector Machines and finalyze with the well-known
Neural-Networks.
